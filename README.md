# Idea: Top-Down Multiplayer Game

### Implementation:
	Front End: Vanilla Javascript, Webpacked with Socket-Client-IO
	Back End:  Node / Express / Socket.io
	Database: MongoDB Atlas
	
### Front Page:
Login: Asks for Username, Password, and Room
Register: Asks for Username, Password, and Character Name

Register creates a new User in the database.
Login against both Username and Password in the database, and forwards you to your desired room with your character
