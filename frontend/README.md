# King of the Iceberg

Immediately after learning standard game architectures, I was always astounded at the sheer amount of operations that a computer could perform milisecond by milisecond. Can a browser game in JS really render a complex simulationist model 30 times a second?
I developed this game to demonstrate "narrow" collision mechanics between every active 'entity' and passive 'tile', and to model some simple physics with momentum, friction, and gravity.

I challenged myself to code this without external libraries and in one page of vanilla javascript.
